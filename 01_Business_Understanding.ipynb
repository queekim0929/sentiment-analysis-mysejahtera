It was initially released soon after the pandemic began, on April 16, 2020, and has gone through various major updates prior to its stable release on 23 July, 2022. As this was a large-scale tracking app used daily by every Malaysian resident, inevitably there were a multitude of problems faced by users. MySejahtera implemented a helpdesk function for FAQs and to contact their team for further assistance. Nonetheless, the app is currently rated 3.9 stars on the Google Play Store, which shows that there is room for improvement. This project focuses on Google Play Store reviews from Mysejahtera users from the first release until current day to analyze customer feedback and suggest potential improvements. \n","### Business Objectives\n","•\tTo detect and understand customer feelings\n","<br/>\n","•\tTo determine viable improvements based on customer feedback \n","### Business Success Criteria\n","•\tThe project can collect 10000 rows of data for analysis\n","<br>\n","•\tThe project can determine 3 reasons for customer dissatisfaction "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"fdd34496","metadata":{"id":"fdd34496"},"source":["## Situation Assessment"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"32ddb635","metadata":{"id":"32ddb635"},"source":["### Inventory of Resources\n","•\tPersonnel: Team members\n","<br>\n","•\tData: Web scraping from Google Play Store Mysejahtera reviews\n","### Requirements\n","•\tProject is completed before due date\n","<br>\n","•\tProject showcases team’s understanding of CRISP-DM\n","### Risks and Contingencies\n","**Risk:** Any of the members are unable to complete their section in time\n","<br>\n","**Contingency:** All members are up-to-date on each other’s progress (via weekly meeting and written progress tracker) and are able to help when needed\n","### Terminology\n","**Sentiment Analysis:** The systematic identification, extraction, quantification, and study of affective states and subjective data using natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics.\n","<br>\n","**Bag of Words:** A simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this model, a text is represented as the bag of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.\n","<br>\n","**CountVectorizer:** Breaks down a sentence or any text into words by performing preprocessing tasks like converting all words to lowercase, thus removing special characters.\n","<br>\n","**TF-IDF:** Short for term frequency–inverse document frequency. It is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n","<br>\n","**Logistic Regression:** Estimates the probability of an event occurring based on a given dataset of independent variables.\n","<br>\n","**K-NN:** A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in a data set. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression.\n","<br>\n","**Decision Tree:** A non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.\n","<br>\n","**Support Vector Machine:** A supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, it is able to categorize new text.\n","<br>\n","**Random Forest:** A commonly-used machine learning algorithm which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.\n","<br>\n","**XGBoost:** Stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. It is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems.\n","<br>\n","**Multinomial Naive Bayes:** The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a Bayesian learning approach popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The program guesses the tag of a text using the Bayes theorem then calculates each tag's likelihood for a given sample and outputs the tag with the greatest chance.\n","<br>\n","**LSTM:** A long short-term memory network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). LSTMs are predominately used to learn, process, and classify sequential data because these networks can learn long-term dependencies between time steps of data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"215fea7d","metadata":{"id":"215fea7d"},"source":["## Determining Data Mining Goals"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"77079122","metadata":{"id":"77079122"},"source":["### Data Mining Goal\n","Graded Sentiment Analysis model\n","### Success Criteria\n","The model built is evaluated to have an optimum accuracy and recall"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2f6e687f","metadata":{"id":"2f6e687f"},"source":["## Project Plan"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2466c6be","metadata":{"id":"2466c6be"},"source":["| Task | Completion Time | Person-in-Charge |\n","| :- | :-: | :-: |\n","| Business Understanding | W8 | Devayani a/p Balkrishnan| \n","| Data Pre-processing | W8 | Oscar Looi Koon Seng| \n","| Exploratory Data Analysis | W8 | Oscar Looi Koon Seng| \n","| Machine Learning Modelling | W9 | Teo Kwee Kim, Ong Horng Neng | \n","| Result Evaluation + Interpretation | W10 | Devayani a/p Balkrishnan, Oscar Looi Koon Seng, Tan Jun Ren | \n","| Deployment | W10 | Tan Jun Ren | \n","| Final code review | W11 | All Members | \n","| Presentation preparation + Recording | W12 | All Members | "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f2c64ded","metadata":{"id":"f2c64ded"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
